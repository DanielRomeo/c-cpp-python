## Creating an all round system of classes
### Creating a small application that takes into consideration almost everything that I have learned in c++ thus far:

### What I could write:
- A class that is a bank, which keeps track of peoples assets(cash in bank, cars, homes and details as well).
- The bank also keeps track of liable persons if users have taken loans(i.e Childen if user does not pay)- so as to pass down the loan down to.
