### What I need to study to complete academic year :2021 Data structures

#### Chapter1:
- [ ] Specify a function to indicate the time and space requirements of a (non-recursive) algorithm in
terms of the input size.
- [ ] Determine the worst case time and space complexity of non-recursive algorithms. 

#### Chapter 3: 
- [x] Declare and manipulate pointer variables.
- [x] Use the new and delete operators to manipulate dynamic variables.
- [x] Use dynamic arrays.
- [x] Distinguish between shallow and deep copies of data.
- [ ] Implement classes with pointer data members.


#### Chapter 5: Linked Lists
- [ ] Explain the basic concepts of linked lists.
- [ ] Implement insertion and deletion operations on linked lists.
- [ ] Implement and manipulate a linked list.
- [ ] Implement and manipulate an ordered list.
- [ ] Apply the STL list container.

#### Cahpter 6: Recursion
- [ ] Understand recursive functions.
- [ ] Implement recursive functions to so

#### Chapter 7: Stacks
- [ ] Explain the basic concepts of stacks.
- [ ] Implement a stack using an array.
- [ ] Apply the STL stack container.

##### What i still need to know
- Why pass an ampersand in between a data type name and function name , when declaring a function
- overloading assignment operator for objects theat have pointers in them
